* Variables that provided a non- random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset that could be considered are wether or not the vehicle is AWD, the spoiler angle, and potentially the vehicle weight.

* The standard Deviation would suggest that the difference between the lots does not meet the requirements of all three lots being within the required design.
